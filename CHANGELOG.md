# Reef - changelog

Every theme in the family carries the same version number, so a number that
moves here moved in all seven. The dated working notes behind each entry, with
the reasoning and the files, are in `wiki/log.md`.

Current version: **1.7.3**.

## 1.7.3 - 2026-09-07

Two family-wide image and font defects, both found by measurement and both
invisible in the code.

- **The hero srcset gained an 800 breakpoint.** The list ran
  `[720, 1200, 1920, 2560]` with `sizes="100vw"`. A 412-point phone at 1.75
  device pixels per point asks for **721** pixels: one more than 720, so the
  browser climbed to the 1200 candidate and paid over a hundred kilobytes for
  a single pixel. The same arithmetic hits a 390-point phone at 2x, which asks
  for 780. An 800 breakpoint catches both and costs the others nothing.
- **The hero is served as AVIF, with WebP as the fallback.** A first-screen
  photograph carries grain and detail, which WebP encodes badly: on Nalu the
  same image went from **186 KB to 42 KB** at identical quality. The
  `<picture>` keeps WebP for browsers that do not read AVIF, so nobody loses.
  `fallbackFormat="webp"` is MANDATORY here: without it Astro builds a PNG
  fallback per breakpoint, close to twenty megabytes of files nobody will ever
  download but that ship on every deploy.
- **Both font files are preloaded.** The `@font-face` rules travel in the
  inlined stylesheet, so the browser only discovers the woff2 after reading
  the CSS: it paints with the fallback face, then swaps. On Kona that swap
  moved the first screen by **0.168 of CLS**, over the 0.1 threshold, because
  its `h1` is bounded in `ch` (a unit that depends on the active font) inside
  a block centred with `my-auto`. Preloading removes the whole class of
  defect, not just the instance of the day. `crossorigin` is mandatory on a
  font preload, or the file is fetched twice.

Measured on the seven demos, Lighthouse mobile, served compressed: Kona 92 to
99, Nalu 93 to 99, Swell 97 to 98, the others unchanged at 98 or 99.
Accessibility, best practices and SEO stay at 100 on all seven. CLS is at or
under 0.003 everywhere, against 0.168 on Kona before.

## 1.7.2 - 2026-09-07

Astro 7.3, a render bench that measures translucent colours instead of giving
up in front of them, and everything it found the hour it learned to.

- The whole family moves to Astro 7.3 (`astro@7.3.1`). Nothing else in the
  dependency tree moved, and the seven themes are green on types, build,
  selfchecks, house lint and the render bench.
- `pnpm verify` COMPOSITES COLOURS. Until this release the contrast check
  declared a ground unreadable as soon as it was not fully opaque, and skipped
  any ink under 95 percent opacity. Both describe ordinary house writing: a
  tinted chip on a card, a note written `text-muted-foreground/80`. The bench
  was therefore silent on a whole family of surfaces a browser paints
  perfectly well, while Lighthouse read them and failed them. It now stacks
  the translucent layers onto the first opaque colour underneath, and blends a
  translucent ink into the result, exactly as the engine paints it. It still
  refuses the one case it truly cannot read, text over a photograph, and it
  finds that case from the rectangle of every image, video and canvas on the
  page instead of guessing from the ancestors.
- It also measures every element that paints its OWN text. It used to start
  from a list of tags and keep only those that contained no other, which
  missed the commonest shape in this codebase: an element carrying an icon AND
  a word.
- What it found here, the same hour: the topic label on the post cards was at
  3.99 to 1 where AA asks 4.5, and the three footer column labels at 3.70. The
  label takes a twelfth semantic role, `text-primary-text`, one step darker on
  the turquoise ramp and pointing back at the primary in dark mode, exactly as
  `text-accent-text` has done for the coral since 1.6.3. The column labels go
  back to full ink: an attenuated recessive role is how a theme quietly loses
  AA.
- The bench stopped changing its mind. It measured 400 ms after its scroll
  pass and hoped that was enough; on a loaded machine it reported "no h1 on
  the page" for pages whose title measured 208 by 54 pixels, on different
  routes at every run. It now waits for a condition instead of a delay: fonts
  arrived, document height and first title box unchanged from one frame to the
  next, and a title that exists in the document has a box. A page that really
  has no h1 answers immediately and is still reported. It also measures five
  widths instead of three: 1024 is the `lg` breakpoint, where a grid goes to
  two columns with the least room to do it, and 1280 is the commonest laptop.
  Neither is coming back out.
- The stylesheet travels inside the HTML (`build.inlineStylesheets: "always"`).
  Lighthouse measured 730 ms of render blocking before the first pixel on the
  demo, from stylesheet requests alone. The trade is written out in
  `astro.config.mjs`, and one word puts it back.
- The demo posters are served by the site. They were fetched from the video
  host, which delivered them and set two third-party cookies on the way: the
  demo's best practices score was capped at 77 for that alone, and the largest
  image on the page depended on a domain the theme does not control. The
  source now lives in `src/assets` and both crops are built. The video stays
  remote, and still loads only on scroll.
- Measured on the demo, mobile, served compressed, before and after:
  best practices 77 to 100, since nothing third-party is fetched any
  more; accessibility to 100; three render-blocking stylesheet requests down
  to zero; first paint and largest paint both earlier on every theme.

## 1.7.1 - 2026-09-05

The filmed sequence scrolls on phones too, the render bench measures dark
mode, and Aloha's title mask stops clipping letters.

- The filmed sequence of the home page (`_film.ts`) now drives the video with
  the scroll on phones as well. Until this release the engine required 1025 px
  of width and left phones a still poster; the portrait clip and the play-pause
  priming of the decoder were already there for this. The only fallbacks left
  are the reader's own: reduced motion and data saving. The scene that mounts
  the engine says so in its comment.
- The render bench (`pnpm verify`) measures every page in both modes, light
  and dark, and `docs/conventions/tailwind.md` writes the rule the dark pass
  enforces: a surface always carries a role (`bg-card`, `bg-background`...)
  and its text the matching role; `bg-white` is admitted only under an ink
  that does not follow the theme. The probe reads an SVG's class with
  `getAttribute` (its `className` is an `SVGAnimatedString`) and honours
  `dark:` display variants.
- In Aloha, `SplitReveal` reveals a title word by word behind a mask, and that
  mask kept cutting descenders, accents and the last glyph of every word once
  the word had landed. It is now lifted the moment the motion ends. The same
  release keeps the second hero button of Aloha inside its glass between 1024
  and 1280 px. Neither fix reaches THIS theme: it does not carry `SplitReveal`,
  and its demo was measured the same way and has no such overflow.
- Code comments in the blog posts were at 3.88 to 1 in dark mode: the dark
  Shiki theme becomes `github-dark-default` (`astro.config.mjs`,
  `src/styles/prose.css`).
- No decorative pill, anywhere: the house rule is written in `AGENTS.md`. The
  featured post card loses its "Featured" label, which said a third time what
  the section eyebrow already says, and the prop that carried it
  (`FeaturedPostCard.astro`, `FeaturedPost.astro`, the `featuredLabel` string
  in both dictionaries). `rounded-pill` stays the shape of buttons, fields and
  the topic chips, which are real links.
- `LICENSE` now holds the MIT text and nothing else, so that GitHub and every
  license scanner read it correctly; what used to sit around it (the Pexels
  licence of the photographs, the demo content, the third-party material)
  moved to `NOTICE.md`, new, and `README.md` and `THIRD-PARTY.md` point there.
  Reef stays MIT: the grant does not change.
- The public repository speaks English end to end: `DEPLOY.md` and `SPEC.md`
  are translated. The README header image answers again.
- `pnpm dev` works on a clean clone: a `predev` script fetches the demo
  photographs into `src/assets/` before the server starts, because the
  repository does not version them, and the README says so. `.gitignore` also
  keeps system files and logs out of the repository.
- Files that differ from 1.7.0 in THIS theme: `package.json`, this changelog,
  `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE.md`, `README.md`,
  `SPEC.md`, `THIRD-PARTY.md`, `astro.config.mjs`, `scripts/verify.mjs`,
  `scripts/verify.probe.mjs`, `docs/conventions/tailwind.md`,
  `src/styles/prose.css`, `src/components/Sections/Home/_film.ts`,
  `src/components/Sections/Home/FilmScene.astro`,
  `src/components/Sections/Home/FeaturedPost.astro`,
  `src/components/Cards/FeaturedPostCard.astro`, `src/i18n/ui/en/pages.ts` and
  `src/i18n/ui/fr/pages.ts`. A pass holder still has one number to remember,
  for seven archives.

## 1.7.0 - 2026-09-02

A seventh theme joins, and the whole family takes its number.

- Kona ships. It is a headless storefront for an existing Shopify shop: the
  catalogue is read at build time from the shop's own public JSON, so there is
  no app to install, no Storefront token to mint and nothing to change on the
  shop. See kona.alohapixel.app.
- Not one line of code changed in THIS theme. Three files differ from 1.6.3 and
  all three are paperwork: `package.json` for the number, this changelog, and
  `docs/design.md` because the family is seven themes and two of them are
  headless. Every other byte is the byte of 1.6.3. Reef stays MIT and its
  LICENSE does not move: the commercial agreement never covered it.

## 1.6.3 - 2026-09-01

The accent could not be read, and the code was barely legible.

- Accent text now meets WCAG AA. The house coral is built to be seen, so on a
  pale ground it landed between 2.6 and 3.7 to 1, where AA asks 4.5 for body
  text. The brand is unchanged: `bg-accent`, `border-accent`, the gradients and
  the title wave keep the exact coral they had, and only text and icons move to
  the new `text-accent-text` role, one step darker on the same ramp. Dark mode
  already cleared AA and does not move at all.
- A drawn phone shows the home page on mobile, once per site, in a column that
  was empty on wide screens and hidden below `lg`. `pnpm poster` re-shoots the
  capture from `dist/`; without a capture the block renders nothing rather than
  a broken frame.
- Three new commands, and the tooling a coding agent needs: `pnpm test`,
  `pnpm lint:house`, `pnpm verify` (a Playwright render bench over `dist/` at
  390, 768 and 1440), plus `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.json`, which the
  1.6.2 archive did not carry.
- Render defects found by the bench and repaired, each one measured before and
  after. The bench now reports no defect at all on this theme.

## 1.6.2 - 2026-08-31

The light ground stops being white.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-08-31

The wave under the accent word was cut in half.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-08-31

The redirect only robots could see.

## 1.5.4 - 2026-08-30

What the sold archive did not have.
